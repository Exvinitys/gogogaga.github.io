	 <meta name="description" content="2048 is a popular web-based game that involves sliding numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. The game is played on a 4x4 grid and each move involves sliding all tiles in a row or column in one of the four directions (up, down, left, or right). Whenever two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile with the sum of their values. The game ends when the grid is full and no more moves can be made, or when the player reaches the 2048 tile. The player's score is based on the value of the highest tile they have achieved.">
